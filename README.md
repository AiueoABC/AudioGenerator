# AudioGenerator
GenerateSimpleAudio  
I want to make it work in GUI. To see what I'm trying to do, pls check GUI branch. Any comments/suggenstions are welcome.

# How to use
Simply run `python main.py`, then you will hear some sounds. To change notes, edit main.py.  
In the code, you will notice I put "note" to generate audio frequency.
